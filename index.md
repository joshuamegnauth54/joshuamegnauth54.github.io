# Projects
* [Admissions2](pages/projects/data/admissions2.html): I analyzed a toy data set on graduate school admissions for my first project.
* [Snowball sampling scraper for Pushshift](https://github.com/joshuamegnauth54/thesis_gamer_scraper): My Master's thesis analyzes the distribution of (a sample) of gamers on Reddit. I wrote a scraper in Rust using the Pushshift API to gather network data as my first Rust project.
