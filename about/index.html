    <p>Hello world! (Sorry. Even I feel disturbed that I started my about me with that.)</p>
<p>My name is Josh. I’m a nascent data scientist and newbie programmer who’s interested in all matters of tech.</p>
<p>The site you’re on right now is my tiny corner where I intend to publish blogs on programming. I’m primarily interested in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust 🦀</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, but maybe I’ll relearn C and learn <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>.</p>
<p>I picked up Rust in 2020 while deciding whether I should relearn C++ and C for a systems programming language. Rust reverberated across threads discussing C++. I had heard of the language years ago but dismissed it as a silly idea because C and C++ were so prominent. I hadn’t programmed since early high school at that time and had no interest in Rust. I studied Python in college primarily for data science, but I always wanted <em>more</em> since that first day of class. I’m passionate about Rust over C (C is awesome, of course) for the same reasons I’m passionate about Python over R.</p>
<p>One day, if I ever master the arcane arts of math like my genius brother, I’ll develop Doom clones and badly written JRPGs.</p>
<p>ALSO. I like coffee and cats. ☕🐈</p>
