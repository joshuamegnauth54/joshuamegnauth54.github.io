Hello world! (Sorry. Even I feel disturbed that I started my about me with that.)

My name is Josh. I'm a nascent data scientist and newbie programmer who's interested in all matters of tech.

The site you're on right now is my tiny corner where I intend to publish blogs on programming. I'm primarily interested in [Rust ü¶Ä](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/), but maybe I'll relearn C and learn [Go](https://golang.org/).

I picked up Rust in 2020 while deciding whether I should relearn C++ and C for a systems programming language. Rust reverberated across threads discussing C++. I had heard of the language years ago but dismissed it as a silly idea because C and C++ were so prominent. I hadn't programmed since early high school at that time and had no interest in Rust. I studied Python in college primarily for data science, but I always wanted _more_ since that first day of class. I'm passionate about Rust over C (C is awesome, of course) for the same reasons I'm passionate about Python over R.

One day, if I ever master the arcane arts of math like my genius brother, I'll develop Doom clones and badly written JRPGs.

ALSO. I like coffee and cats. ‚òïüêà
