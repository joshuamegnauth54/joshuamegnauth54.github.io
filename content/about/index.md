Hello world! (Sorry. Even I feel disturbed that I started my about me with that.)

My name is Josh. I'm a nascent data scientist and newbie programmer who's interested in all matters of tech.

The site you're on right now is my tiny corner where I intend to publish blogs on programming. I'm primarily interested in [Rust 🦀](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/), but maybe I'll relearn C and learn [Go](https://golang.org/) one day.

One day, if I ever master the arcane arts of math like my genius brother, I'll develop Doom clones and badly written JRPGs.

ALSO. I like coffee and cats. ☕🐈
